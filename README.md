# Server Connect

I was tired of running either command line tools or using webpages, so i created a very simple app, that uses the HP Ilo connect (stand alone app)
It stores the IPMI/ILO creds in the textfile (working on it), so make sure you save it on a secure spot!

The currecntr link to "HPE Lights-Out Standalone Remote Console for Windows" is

Very simple, it reads a xml file, present the list and give the user the ability to selct and click, done
